**htmlTools** is a set of tools for creating simple HTML documents in Matlab.
The focus is on generating HTML documentation of code using Matlab’s publish
function.

 

**Documentation**

Run CodeDescriptions.m to generate HTML documentation for this project. This
will generate HTML documentation for all functions in a new directory titled
Documentation. Brief descriptions of all functions can be found in the
TABLE\_OF\_CONTENTS.html document.
